            <p>They said it couldn’t be done. They said we were foolish to try. But
              Grillchefmeister Michael is planning on doing what doubters said
              couldn’t, nay, shouldn’t be done! Grill outside in the lovely fall
              weather we’re currently experiencing. So come early, come often to the
              Open House Wednesday night, and experience the Thrill of the Grill when
              you can actually use some nice hot food.</p>

            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it
              has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste
              for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.
              Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I
              know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it
              out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say
              it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature
              is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
